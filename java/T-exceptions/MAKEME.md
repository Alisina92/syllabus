// try catch finally
// throws

### 1. Complete this program so when it breaks it does not exit the program, but instead prints out a message that an exception has been thrown. Use a try/catch block.
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int x = 10 / 0; // this will throw an exception since you cannot divide by zero

    }
}
```
